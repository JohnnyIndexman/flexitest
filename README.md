# Notes App

A simple and elegant note-taking application inspired by Google Keep. Built using **React.js**, **Chakra UI** for styling, and **Context API** for state management, this app demonstrates proficiency in implementing **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in a real-world scenario.

This project was created as the final hands-on assignment for **Flexisaf Edusoft**, showcasing the ability to build functional, visually appealing, and user-friendly applications.
